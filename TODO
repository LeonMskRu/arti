KEY:
- Not done
. Partially done
o complete
X Won't do.



- Decisions
  - Which protocols to support?
  - How far up the stack to go?
  - How speculative to get?

- Specs
  - Test vectors
    . Add test vectors for ntor
    - Add test vectors for relay crypto
    - Add test vectors for hs-ntor
    - Add test vectors for hs-relay crypto
    - Add test vectors for TAP
  - Clarity
    - END cell format
  - Directory consistency
    - "-----BEGIN" should not be a valid keyword
    - Whitespace at start of line, y/n?  Mixed whitespace, y/n? CR, y/n?
    - UTF-8.

- Primitive crypto
  - Wrap x25519 in a trait
  - Use signature trait for ed25519?
  - Ed25519 needs to have an "identity" non-parsed version, maybe.
  o Add RSA-pkcs1 signature support
  o Add RSA-pem encode/decode support
  - RSA-oaep, if supported.
  o test vectors for sha1
  o test vectors for sha2
  o test vectors for sha3/shake
  - RSA test vectors as needed

- Higher level crypto
  - Test vectors for hmac
  - Test vectors for tap-kdf
  - Test vectors for hkdf
  - Test vectors for other kdfs

- Main Protocol functionality
  o encode and decode regular cell types.
  . handshakes
    o ntor
  . relay crypto
    o implement
    - tests
  - Internals:
    - Consider using a safer thing instead of current bytereader.  Like the
      one rustls has? Like "untrusted"?
    - Consider using a writer trait that's agnostic about whether it's
      writing into an expanding Vec or a fixed slice.
    - Use "bytes" crate more natively in tor-bytes trait.
  - Tests
    - For all cell types
    - for all relay cell types
    - For all handshakes
  - State for multiplexing circuits on a connection
  - State for sending sendme cells, both versions.
    - V1 sendmes
  - State for managing streams
  - Initial protocol handshake for client/relay authentication
  - Initial protocol handshake for relay/relay authentication

- Directory parsing stuff
  . Parsing backend
    - Match tor's actual token behavior?
  - Parse consensus directories, both variants.
  - Apply consensus diffs

- Directory encoding stuff
  - Encoding/signing backend
  - Encode descriptors

- Additional small functionality, protocol level
  - Relay padding

- HS functionality
  - encode and decode hs cell types
  - State as needed for hs lookup
  - hs cell types
  - hs directory stuff
    - HSv3 directory obejcts, encode
    - HSv3 directory objects, decode
  - crypto variants
    - hsv3 variant of relay crypto
    - hsv3 variant of ntor
    - tests and vectors for the above.

X Not currently planning to do:
  X Link protocol v1 (multicert)
  X Link protocol v2 (renegotiation)

- Unsure if planning to do:
  X Link protocol v3 (short circuit IDs, PK comparison)
  - Linkauth 1 (RSA-SHA256-TLSSecret)
  - Parsing votes
  - HSv2 directory support
  - Supporting relays without ed25519 keys.
  - Compute consensus diffs

- Waiting on RSA-OAEP:
  - Handshakes
    - TAP
  - HSv2 handshakes
