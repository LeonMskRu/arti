rust itself:
 * specialization for u8.
 * generic arrays via associated consts or whatever it's called.
 * when an enum is c-like, implement try_into for numbers.  (but see num_enum and many similar crates.)
 * stabilize trailing_ones() [DONE in 1.46]

curve25519-dalek:
* let me go from a montogmery point to a compressed edwards point.

*-dalek:
* let me use the right rand trait kthx

ed25519-dalek:
* defer signature verification without prehash mode.  A signature
  future would be great.

base64:
* multiline support.

phf:
* much cheaper hash function

rsa:
* get raw signed data, to allow multiple signed formats.

crypto:
* key agreement trait

ed25519 trait:
* batch support.

native-tls:
* Support for RFC5705 exporters



# Not actually using these crates:

bitvec
* more efficient bitwise operations.

ring:
* static curve25519

pem:
* should use multiline support or at least not copy when decoding
  base64 multiline.
* should be stricter?

rsa-der:
* Support for RSA key without OID

webpki:
* Support for cert without extensions and/or without alpn

tls-api:
* Async support
* Support for disabling certificate & hostname verification
* Support for getting certificate (or does it have it?)
* Support for RFC5705 exporters
