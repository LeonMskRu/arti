rust itself:
 * specialization for u8.
 * generic arrays via associated consts or whatever it's called.
 * when an enum is c-like, implement try_into for numbers.  (but see num_enum and many similar crates.)
 * stabilize traling_one()

curve25519-dalek:
* let me go from a montogmery point to a compressed edwards point.

*-dalek:
* let me use the right rand trait kthx

ed25519-dalek:
* defer signature verification without prehash mode.  A signature
  future would be great.

base64:
* multiline support.

phf:
* much cheaper hash function

rsa:
* oaep
* if not oaep, raw?
* get raw signed data to allow multiple signed formats.

crypto:
* key agreement trait

ed25519 trait:
* batch support.



Not actually using these crates:

bitvec
* more efficient bitwise operations.

ring:
* static curve25519

pem:
* should use multiline support or at least not copy when decoding
  base64 multiline.
* should be stricter?

rsa-der:
* Support for RSA key without OID
